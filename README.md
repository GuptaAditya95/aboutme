## Lab and Research Work
**Data Science Consultant - [Sahapedia Labs](https://www.sahapedia.org/about-us)**
- Sahapedia is an open encyclopedic resource on the arts, cultures and histories of India. Sahapedia offers digital content in multimedia format—articles and books, photo essays and video, interviews and oral histories, maps and timelines, authored by scholars and curated by experts. Subject areas range from ideas and belief systems, rituals and practices, to visual and performing arts
- During my tenure as a consultant and data scientist at Sahapedia Labs, I had the privilege to contribute to a project that aligned perfectly with my passion for arts, cultures, and technology. Sahapedia, being an open encyclopedic resource focused on the diverse arts, cultures, and histories of India, provided a unique platform to explore and innovate in the realm of digital content creation and curation
- Our primary project was centered around creating an innovative application for the editors at Sahapedia, aimed at streamlining the annotation process for the latest articles. The goal was to simplify the annotation process by leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) technology, enabling editors to quickly and accurately annotate articles
  - One of the key aspects of the project was implementing a Named Entity Recognizer. This technology identified entities such as names of people, places, organizations, events, and more within the articles. Editors could then easily select from suggested annotations, saving time and ensuring consistency in the annotation process
  - A significant part of our project involved the creation of ontologies related to cultures, beliefs, practices, and other subject areas covered by Sahapedia. These ontologies organized information hierarchically and helped establish relationships between different cultural elements
  - Once the ontologies were established, we utilized Neo4j, a powerful graph database, to visually represent these relationships. The graph visualization provided an intuitive and dynamic way to explore connections between various cultural elements, enhancing the overall user experience and understanding
- Throughout the project, collaboration with scholars, experts, and curators was crucial. Their insights and domain knowledge were instrumental in refining the NER suggestions, creating accurate ontologies, and ensuring the cultural context was appropriately represented in the graph visualization
- The application we developed not only streamlined the annotation process but also enhanced the quality and consistency of annotations across Sahapedia's vast content. Additionally, the Neo4j-based graph visualization provided a dynamic way for users to explore the intricate web of cultural connections

**Research Intern @ Medical Imaging Research Center (Dept. of Medical Electronics, Dayananda Sagar Institutions,Bangalore) (_Jan 2017 - Jul 2017_)**
- Interned at Medical Imaging Research Center (MIRC), collaborating on a project funded by the Department of Science and Technology, India, 
to reconstruct a low-cost MRI machine
- Designed and developed a critical Gradient Power Amplifier to handle large currents, contributing to essential power electronics subsystems 
for the MRI machine under the guidance of [Prof Sairam Geethanath](https://mr.research.columbia.edu/content/sairam-geethanath)
- Conducted in-house test, simulation, and PCB design for the Gradient Power Amplifier, directly impacting the development of the MRI 
machine at the research center

**Lab Intern @ Arduino Inc India (_Jun 2016 - Jul 2017_)**
- During my internship at Arduino Labs India, I had the opportunity to work on a significant project that revolved around developing a high-current capacity motor driver board. Arduino Labs India, being the sole office of Arduino in the country, offered an exciting environment to contribute to cutting-edge technology and innovation
- My primary project involved the design, development, and optimization of a high-current capacity motor driver board. This board was intended to be an essential component in the production pipeline, catering to a global audience of hobbyists, makers, and robotics enthusiasts who utilize Arduino platforms.
  - A crucial initial phase of the project involved in-depth research to understand the specific requirements and challenges of the high-current motor driver. This phase helped in setting clear design goals and identifying potential technical obstacles to overcome.
  - Once the design goals were established, I was involved in creating the layout for the motor driver board. This process required careful consideration of components' placements, traces, and connections to ensure optimal performance and efficiency.
  - Before moving to the manufacturing phase, rigorous simulation and testing were conducted to validate the board's functionality and performance under various scenarios. This step aimed to catch any design flaws or issues before moving forward.
  - Collaborating with production teams, I contributed to integrating the motor driver board into the manufacturing pipeline. This included addressing any manufacturing-specific challenges and ensuring seamless scalability for mass production.
- As part of enhancing my understanding of servo motors and their applications, I had the opportunity to attend robotics trade fairs. These visits provided invaluable insights into the industry trends, applications of servo motors, and allowed me to connect with experts and enthusiasts.
- The motor driver board's significance lay in its ability to empower hobbyists and makers to experiment with precision control of motors. This resonated with Arduino's ethos of enabling creativity and innovation within the maker community.
- Working on a project that was slated for worldwide production underscored the global impact of my contributions. The board I contributed to would find its way into projects and experiments in various corners of the world, enriching the DIY and robotics landscape.
